1. This is full stack school project in which I use react for front end and node.js for back end.  
2. At homepage, there are three default access roles which represent different access levels.  
3. I upload the mysql database file as well in order to falicitate the webiste functionality test if interested.  
4. I am going to keep sharpening my development skills and optimizing my wesbite, so it may look different from the moment the website was visited last time.
